# Front_End_Django_TransactionApp

This Django project is for designing an abstracted and simplified model of PayPal. A user is able to send money to other
registered users, request money from other registered users, and manage their account through the web interface, such as
viewing recent transactions. We will go through introducing the presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer,
security layer, web services, RPC, and Cloud implementation. Each step will be detailly described of how itâ€™s been done.
